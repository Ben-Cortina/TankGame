Description:
    This Game is a simple tank warfare simulator. The user is given control of a tank
and a random number of hostile tanks are created as well. The goal of the game is
eliminate all the enemy tanks before they destroy your tank. The enemy tanks only take
one hit to destroy while the users tank can survive ten hits. Forgive the AI, it was 
my first time creating an AI.
